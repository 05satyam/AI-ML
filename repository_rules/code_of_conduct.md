# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as maintainers, contributors, and community members pledge to make
participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone.
Regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation, everyone deserves respect. We commit to acting
in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and
healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by mistakes
  and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks.
* Public or private harassment or threats.
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They
retain the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate
reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the project in public
spaces. Examples include using an official project e‑mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting the maintainers via the email address listed in
the `SECURITY.md` file. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the
privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

The maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that do not align to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
