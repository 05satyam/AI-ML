# **GenAI Interview Experience & Q&A**

## **Q1: Optimizing a RAG Pipeline for Low-Latency & High Retrieval Accuracy**
**Q:** How would you optimize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to reduce latency while maintaining retrieval accuracy?  

**A:** Optimizing RAG requires balancing retrieval efficiency, response latency, and accuracy. Key strategies include:  

### **Retriever Optimization**
- **Vector Index Optimization** – Use FAISS HNSW or ScaNN for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search instead of brute-force retrieval.  
- **Hybrid Retrieval** – Combine BM25 (keyword-based retrieval) with dense embeddings to improve recall while minimizing retrieval iterations.  
- **Chunking Strategy** – Optimize document chunk sizes for better context while reducing irrelevant data retrieval.  
- **Query Expansion & Preprocessing** – Use a small LLM to rephrase/expand queries before embedding them into the vector database.  

### **Reducing Unnecessary Calls**
- **Caching Mechanisms** – Store frequently retrieved responses at the retrieval or API layer to minimize redundant queries.  

### **LLM Optimization**
- **Model Selection** – Use a smaller, fine-tuned model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) for faster inference.  
- **Token Streaming** – Stream partial responses instead of waiting for full completion in chat applications.  
- **Multi-Stage RAG** – First, use a fast retriever (BM25), then apply computationally expensive reranking only when necessary.  

### **Infrastructure Scaling**
- **Efficient Hardware Deployment** – Optimize inference with GPU acceleration (A100/H100) or TPUs with tensor parallelism.

## **Q2: Transformer-Based LLM Architectures & Use Cases**
**Q:** Can you explain the different variations of Transformer-based LLM architectures and their ideal use cases?  

**A:** The Transformer architecture has three primary variations, each designed for specific NLP tasks: **Autoencoders, Autoregressors, and Sequence-to-Sequence Models.**  

### **LLM Architecture Variations**

| Model Type | Architecture | Example Models | Training Method | Best Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Autoencoders** (Encoder-Only) | Uses only the encoder, discarding the decoder | BERT, RoBERTa | Masked Language Modeling (MLM) | Text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER) |
| **Autoregressors** (Decoder-Only) | Uses only the decoder, discarding the encoder | GPT series (GPT-3, GPT-4), BLOOM | Causal Language Modeling (CLM) | Text generation, chatbots, code completion |
| **Sequence-to-Sequence Models** (Encoder-Decoder) | Uses both encoder and decoder | T5, BART | Span corruption & reconstruction | Machine translation, text summarization, data-to-text generation |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Autoencoders**: Best for understanding text and extracting meaningful representations.  
- **Autoregressors**: Best for generating coherent and context-dependent text.  
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Best for transforming input sequences into structured outputs.  

Each architecture serves a distinct purpose, and selecting the right one depends on the specific task requirements.

## **Q3: Impact of Removing Hidden Layers in Neural Networks**
**Q:** What happens if you remove hidden layers from a neural network? Which logical operator cannot be used?  

**A:** Removing hidden layers **reduces a neural network to a simple linear classifier**, significantly affecting its ability to model complex patterns.  

- **Linearly separable problems** (e.g., AND, OR) can still be solved.  
- **Non-linearly separable problems** (e.g., XOR) cannot be solved without hidden layers.  
- **Without activation functions in hidden layers**, the model behaves like a linear regression model, losing the ability to capture complex relationships.  

Hidden layers enable non-linearity, allowing networks to capture deeper patterns between input features.
