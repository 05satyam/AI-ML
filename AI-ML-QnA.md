**Q1.** What happens if you remove hidden layers from a neural network - which logical operator cannot be used? <br />
**Ans.** 
- Without hidden layers, a neural network becomes just a simple linear classifier. 
- i.e. it can handle straightforward, linearly separable tasks like AND and OR but it cannot handle XOR (exclusive OR), which needs at least one hidden layer to capture its non-linear pattern.
- And, removing the non linear activation functions from hidden nodes will cause in linearity. Having hidden nodes without non linear activations is equivalent to having a linear model.
