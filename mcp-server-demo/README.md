# Why Did We Use mount() in FastAPI?
  - mount() lets you embed multiple MCP servers into a single FastAPI app under different paths

## Can We Do External Tool Mounts?
  - Yes, you can expose external tools (from other systems, APIs, scripts, or microservices) by:
  - Wrapping them in MCP @mcp.tool() decorators.
  - Using HTTP clients (like httpx) to call remote APIs.
  - Streaming output back via MCP.
