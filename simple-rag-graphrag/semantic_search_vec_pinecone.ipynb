    "Transformer Models: The library utilizes transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc., which are pre-trained on large corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n",
    "Pooling Strategies: After processing input text through a transformer, a pooling layer aggregates token embeddings to form a single embedding for the entire sentence or text. Common strategies include mean, max, and CLS token pooling.\n",
    "Applications\n",
    "Semantic Textual Similarity: By embedding sentences into high-dimensional vectors, the library can be used to compare and compute similarities between texts, useful for tasks such as duplicate detection or information retrieval.\n",
