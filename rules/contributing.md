# Contributing to the AI‑ML‑GenAI Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to be a
comprehensive, high‑quality resource for artificial intelligence,
machine learning and generative AI practitioners. Whether you’re
fixing typos, writing tutorials, adding new notebooks or improving
documentation, your help is appreciated.

The guidelines below will help you submit contributions that align
with our community standards and technical expectations.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in this project are expected to abide by the
[Code of Conduct]. Please read it to understand
the behavior that we expect from contributors.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways you can help, both technical and non‑technical.

* **Add examples and notebooks.** Provide well‑documented Jupyter
  notebooks or scripts that demonstrate AI/ML concepts, model
  training or generative AI techniques. Each file should include a
  short description of its purpose, prerequisites and expected
  outcomes. Keep materials up to date; outdated examples discourage
  users.
* **Improve documentation.** Expand the README or folder‑level
  documentation to explain how the repository is organized. Use plain
  language and clear headings.
* **Report bugs or issues.** If you encounter broken code, dead
  links or inaccurate information, please open an issue describing the
  problem and, if possible, how to reproduce it.
* **Propose new topics.** Suggest new areas or technologies for
  coverage (e.g., reinforcement learning, edge ML, fairness &
  ethics). Please open an issue to discuss before submitting large
  additions.
* **Translation and accessibility.** Help translate documentation
  into other languages or improve accessibility by adding alt text to
  images and making links descriptive.
* **Community support.** Answer questions in discussions, review
  pull requests and promote the project on social media or
  conferences.

## Development environment

1. **Fork the repository.** Use the GitHub “Fork” button to create
   your own copy under your account.
2. **Clone your fork locally.**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your‑username>/AI-ML.git
   cd AI-ML
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies. A
requirements.txt file may be provided. If not, install the
necessary packages manually. For example:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
4. Run the notebooks. Use Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to
execute and test any notebooks you plan to modify or contribute.

5. Branch off main. Create a descriptive branch name for your
work:
```
git checkout -b feature/add-transformer-demo
```

6. Make your changes. Ensure code is clearly commented and
notebooks contain explanatory text. Follow existing coding style
conventions where possible.

7. Add tests or demonstrations. If your contribution involves
code, include a simple test or example that shows it works as
intended. For notebooks, this could be a small dataset or a
colab link.

8. Commit your changes. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
summarizing the intent of each change. Avoid lumping multiple
unrelated changes into a single commit.

9. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
```
git push origin feature/add-transformer-demo
```

On GitHub, click “Compare & pull request” and complete the
template. Describe the motivation and include any relevant issue
numbers. Mark your PR as a “Draft” if it is still in progress.

10. Address review feedback. Maintainers and other contributors
may review your pull request and suggest changes. Please be
responsive and polite in your interactions; remember that we all
share the same goal of improving the project.

## Communication channels
For general questions and discussions, please use the GitHub
Discussions tab or open an issue. If you need help setting up the
development environment, feel free to ask. 

## Acknowledging contributions
We value and recognize everyone’s contributions. A contributors list
will be maintained in the README or a separate file. Feel free to add
yourself to the AUTHORS file in your pull request, if one exists.

Thank you again for taking the time to improve this project. Your
contributions help make AI and ML education more accessible for
everyone!
