    "- It is a lightweight Python library for building **agent-based systems** where multiple agents collaborate on a task. Inspired by real-world team dynamics, it allows developers to build AI systems with **modular, task-driven, and role-based architecture**.\n",

    "| Concept    | Description |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Agent**  | An LLM-powered unit with a `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`. Handles one or more tasks. |\n",
    "| **Task**   | A unit of work to be handled by a specific agent. Has a `description` and `expected_output`. |\n",
    "| **Crew**   | A team of agents organized in a logical sequence to complete a workflow. |\n",
    "| **Tools**  | External actions the agent can use â€” e.g., web search, file reader, code executor. |\n",
    "| **Memory** | Agent can retain conversation or task-specific state across steps (coming soon). |\n"
